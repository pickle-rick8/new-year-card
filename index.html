                    <p>Dear Bea,</p>
                    <h1 class="heading" style="text-align: start;">Happy New Year!</h1>
                    <p>I made you a gift.
                        <br>It's a picture of us in Steven Universe, your favorite TV Cartoon.</p>
                    <p>I’ve never known the entire plot of Steven Universe, but there's a part of their story that stayed with me. A story that you once told me.  It was when Steven proposed to Connie, the love of his life. Connie turned it down because they were still young and had so much time. They have to be their own person too.</p>
                    <p>2024 was our first year of spending time together, and
                        it was different than the other years passed. Because this time, I have you.
                        You're fun to be with, and always make me laugh. You're good to me.
                        I want to be my own person– a better version of it– because I am inspired by who you are and how you treat people.
                        </p>
                    <p>This was a year of firsts for us, and like Steven and Connie, we've got a long way to go.
                        The life and responsibility of adulthood are expecting us.
                       <br> We still have so much time, but I hope I get to spend those time together with you.
                        </p>
                    <p>I’m glad that I met you, Bea.
                        To more years with you.
                        </p>
                    <p>Love, <br/>Daren</p>
